# Project 1: Learn Tagalog
### Successes
- I was able to do almost all of the flashcards without help from the videos.
- I was able to be creative in some areas once I was comfortable with where I was headed with the app and felt like I was able to add some value to it if a user was looking into learning this specific language.
- I really tried to make sure I used what I knew and understood what I didn’t yet know. I used ChatGPT to explain many things, but almost all the code I wrote was either help from the videos or written by me.
- I felt that this project helped me see how the MVVM structure works and solidified that understanding for me. After being in the weeds with it and looking at it at the end view, I feel like I could do that again in much less time with what I understand now.
### NEEDS WORK
- I wanted to make a overall progress view that would make viewing progress with many topics more intuitive, but I failed to realize that instead of passing the view model to each view, I instantiated a new one which set me back a long ways. Environment Objects are incredibly useful (and I would argue necessary).
- I feel like there are some places where I have code that doesn’t need to be there with the MVVM model. I used a lot of `@State` variables that I think could’ve gone into the model or view model. I couldn’t figure out how to do that with how my code was working.
- I could go on and on because I’m very self-critical, but I just need to have my hands on the keyboard for more time to gain some intuition on different problems to solve with Swift.
